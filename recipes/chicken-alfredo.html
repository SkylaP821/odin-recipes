        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add chicken, 1/2 of the garlic, and Italian seasoning. 
            Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
            Remove from the skillet and set aside. </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
            Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in the skillet. 
            Add onion, mushrooms, and remaining garlic; saut√© until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes.
            Stir in flour, salt, and pepper; cook for 2 minutes.
            Slowly add milk and half-and-half; cook and stir until smooth and creamy.
            Stir in both cheeses until melted. </li>
        <li>
            Stir in chicken mixture, tomatoes, and sour cream. Serve over cooked fettuccini.
        </li>
    </ol>
